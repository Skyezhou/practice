You and 𝐾−1 friends want to buy 𝑁 different pieces of candy. 
Candy piece 𝑖 costs 𝑝𝑖. 
The candy shop owner is greedy and wants to maximize his number of new customers, 
so he increases the sale price of the candy for repeated customers; 
more precisely, if a customer has already purchased 𝑥 pieces of candy, then the cost of candy 𝑖 is 𝐶𝑖∗(𝑥+1)


Find and print the minimum cost for your group to purchase all 𝑁 pieces of candy.

The input:

N: the number of candies to buy
K: the number of people
C: the cost of candy

The output:

the total cost

#answer
def problem2(N, K, C):
    #sort costs decreasing
    C = sorted(C,reverse = True)

    #variable to store the cost
    cost = 0
    x = 0
    flag = 0
    
    for i in C:
        cost += i*(x+1)
        flag += 1
        if flag%K == 0:
            x += 1
        

    return(cost)
